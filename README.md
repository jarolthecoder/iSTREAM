## About the project
This project was originally a challenge from <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">FrondenMentor</a>, all assets were downloaded from the site. To be able to display all the media data online, I have built my own API using <a href="https://mockapi.io/">MockAPI</a>. Currently I am working on a login/sign-up feature to add, if you are a backend or fullstack developer and you would like to team up and work together on this funcionality, feel free to message me ðŸ¤™.
